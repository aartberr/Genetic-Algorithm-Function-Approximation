# Genetic Algorithm for Function Approximation  

This project was created as part of a course assignment for the **Optimization techniques** class at **ECE, AUTH University**.

This project implements a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to approximate an unknown function **f(u₁, u₂)** using **a linear combination of Gaussian functions**. The goal is to find a **low-complexity analytical expression** that best fits given input-output data.  

## **Problem Description**

We consider a system with two inputs **u₁, u₂** and an unknown function **y = f(u₁, u₂)**. Since the analytical form of **f** is unknown, we approximate it using a sum of **at most 15 Gaussian functions** of the form:  

$$G(u₁, u₂) = e^{-\left(\frac{(u_1 -c_1)^2}{2\sigma_1^2} + \frac{(u_2 -c_2)^2}{2\sigma_2^2}\right)}$$  

For the evaluation of the algorithm, we assume that the results are generated from the function:  

$$f(u_1, u_2) = \sin(u_1 + u_2) \sin(u_2^2)$$  

where:  
- $u_1 \in [-1,2]$ 
- $u_2 \in [-2,1]$  

However, the function can be adjusted as needed.

## **Genetic Algorithm Implementation**  
- **Chromosome Representation**: Each chromosome consists of a **15×5 matrix**, where each row represents a Gaussian term with its parameters.  
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Measures how well a candidate function fits the input-output data.  
- **Genetic Operations**:  
  - **Selection**: Fitter chromosomes have a higher probability of being chosen as parents.  
  - **Crossover**: New solutions are generated by combining two parent chromosomes.  
  - **Mutation**: Random small changes in parameters to introduce diversity.  
  - **New Population Generation**: The best solutions survive and create offspring for the next generation.  

## **Files**  

- **Geneticalgorithm.m** – Main script that runs the entire genetic algorithm.  
- **evaluateFitness.m** – Computes the fitness of each chromosome based on how well it approximates the target function.  
- **selectParents.m** – Implements parent selection based on fitness scores.  
- **crossover.m** – Performs crossover between two parent chromosomes to create offspring.  
- **mutate.m** – Applies mutation to introduce small variations in offspring.  
- **newpopulation.m** – Generates a new population from selected parents.  
- **evaluateResults.m** – Assesses and visualizes the final function approximation.  

## **Usage**  
To run the genetic algorithm in MATLAB:  

```matlab
% Run the main script
Geneticalgorithm
```

You can modify hyperparameters such as **population size, mutation rate, and fitness threshold** in `Geneticalgorithm.m` to experiment with different configurations.  

## **Future Work**  
- Extend the approach to support **non-Gaussian basis functions**.  
- Improve mutation strategies for better convergence.  
- Compare GA-based function approximation with **other regression techniques** like neural networks.
